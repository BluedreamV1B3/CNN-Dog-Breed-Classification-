# The Dataset: Stanford Dogs
The Stanford Dogs dataset has images of 120 dog breeds from around the world.

The contents of the dataset are:
- ***Number of Categories*** = 120
- ***Total Number of images*** = 20,580

The number of images per dog breed is low to train a neural network from scratch.
Hence it would be beneficial to use transfer learning. 
The dataset is imported from tensorflow data.
The data can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/stanford_dogs

# Xception
Xception is a convolutional neural network that is 71 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database . The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images.
The network is shown below.

# Challenges The network might face
The dataset contains dog breeds which are visually similar to each other.
This might cause challenges for the network.

As you can see Swiss mountain dogs and Bernese Mountain dogs are very similar

# Training and Testing accuracy
After training with 80%-20% training and validation split respectively the results are as follows.
- ***Training accuracy*** = 94%
- ***Testing accuracy*** = 84%
